# Doggo-Showcase
Doggo Showcase is a compact learning project focused on understanding how to interact with public REST APIs

## Objective
This project helps learners practice the essentials of API work:
* Making HTTP GET requests
* Handling JSON responses
* Updating a UI based on fetched data
* Managing loading and error states
* Writing clean, readable code
* Structuring a minimal, functional application
The goal is to build a self-contained mini project that demonstrates the student’s ability to consume a public API.

## API Endpoint
This project uses the publicly available endpoint:

```
https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random
```

## What You Can Build
Participants can create any small interface of their choice:
* A simple website that displays a new dog image on button click with the Breed Name
* A mobile app that refreshes images with the Breed Name
* A clean card-style viewer 
* Any UI experiment that uses the API effectively

Creativity in presentation is encouraged, but the core requirement remains API interaction.
